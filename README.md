“Hi Teresa
Your project simply blew me away! You have attempted such a huge project, and nailed it in such an
elegant manner. I believe you have spent weeks after weeks on this project, way above the
expectations set by Udacity. I am going to nominate this for Best Project.”

I enjoyed my first attempt. I have a long way to go. :)
